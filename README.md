# ICC World Cup 2019 Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a Jupyter Notebook project that predicts the outcome of ICC World Cup 2019 matches using machine learning. The project uses Python programming language, and the necessary libraries are listed in `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `icc_world_cup_2019_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run the code cells in the notebook.
3. The predicted outcome of the ICC World Cup 2019 matches will be displayed in the output of the last code cell.

Note: Make sure to have the required dataset in the `datasets` folder. If you want to use your own dataset, make sure to provide the path to the dataset in the code.

## Dataset

The project uses the ICC World Cup 2019 Dataset which can be found in the `datasets` folder.
